David stirred in his bed, the moonlight casting a silver glow on his naked body. He had always been a restless sleeper, but tonight felt different. A thick rope bit into his wrists, pulling them taut above his head. Panic flooded through him as he realized he was bound, unable to move. He tried to scream, but a ball gag filled his mouth, muffling his protests. His eyes shot open, wide with shock.

Looming over him, he saw three figures, three pairs of gleaming eyes that matched the gleaming cocks they each possessed. His heart hammered in his chest as he recognized Ava, Lyssara, and Alexandria—three teenage girls from his neighborhood who had somehow invaded his most private of spaces. Their smiles were twisted with mischief, their bodies lithe and eager.

Ava, the Japanese-American beauty with pink hair and a cock that could put a porn star to shame, spoke first. "Good evening, David," she purred, her voice dripping with sweet sarcasm. "We've been watching you for quite some time, and we've decided it's your lucky night."

David's eyes darted around the room, searching for any means of escape, but his body remained frozen in place, the ropes holding him in a spread eagle, vulnerable and exposed. His mind raced, trying to understand what was happening, why they had chosen him, and what they wanted.

Lyssara, the tall redhead with a cock that was more of a weapon than an organ of pleasure, leaned in closer, her eyes glinting with excitement. "You see, David, we know all about your little fantasies," she whispered, her breath hot on his ear. "You think about us, don't you? You think about how we'd feel, how we'd taste...how we'd fuck you into submission."

Alexandria, the raven-haired seductress with the dark makeup, took a step closer, her large breasts heaving with each breath. "But we're not just here for your pleasure, darling," she said with a smirk. "We're here for ours. And we're going to show you just how much fun it can be to be at the mercy of three young futanari who know exactly what they want."

Their plan was simple and diabolical—they had drugged him with a cocktail that not only kept him hard but also made him incredibly sensitive to touch. The first taste of their intentions came when Ava straddled his chest, her cock pressing against his neck, a clear message of dominance. She squeezed his nipples, sending bolts of pleasure-pain through his body.

"You're going to take us all, David," she said, her voice low and commanding. "And you're going to love every second of it."

Lyssara, not one to be outdone, grabbed a bottle of lubricant and a handful of pills from the nightstand. "These little beauties are going to make sure you stay nice and hard for us," she said, shaking the pills in his face. "And don't worry, they're all natural. We wouldn't want to do anything to hurt our new plaything."

With a wicked grin, she crushed the pills and mixed them with the lubricant. David's eyes widened in horror as she began to rub the concoction over his erect cock, the sensation driving him wild with arousal despite his fear.

"Now, let's get started," Ava said, climbing off his chest and moving to stand beside the bed. "We need you to be ready for us. And by ready, I mean begging for it."

The three girls took turns, each one playing with him in a different way. Ava used her mouth, her teeth grazing the sensitive skin of his cock while her tongue danced around the head. Lyssara took his nipples between her fingers, twisting and pinching them until he was moaning around the ball gag. Alexandria teased his ass, her fingers playing at his entrance, driving him insane with anticipation.

Suddenly, Ava was there, straddling his face. "Open your mouth," she ordered. David had no choice but to obey, his mind racing as she lowered her cock to his lips. He could taste the sweetness of her precum, and it sent his senses into overdrive. He didn't know if he was more terrified or turned on.

As Ava began to fuck his face, Lyssara took his hard cock in her hand and stroked it firmly. "Look how eager you are," she said, her voice filled with amusement. "You're going to be our little cum slut tonight."

Alexandria, ever the master of restraint, took her turn, sliding her cock into his ass without a moment of hesitation. He felt a burning sensation as she pushed past his tight ring, but the pleasure was undeniable. His body betrayed him, responding to her every thrust with a moan or a whimper.

The girls switched positions, each one taking turns filling his holes and making him beg for more. They whispered sweet nothings in his ear, calling him their little slut and their toy. They laughed as he struggled against his bonds, his body responding to their every touch despite his mind screaming for them to stop.

Suddenly, Lyssara climbed onto the bed, straddling his hips. "You know what I want, don't you?" she asked, her eyes gleaming with lust.

Alexandria nodded, understanding her friend's desires all too well. "You're going to breed him," she murmured, her hand still stroking David's cock. "Make him feel what it's like to be filled with your seed."

Lyssara leaned down, her breasts brushing against his chest as she whispered, "You're going to be our little breeding bitch, David."

Without warning, she slammed her cock into his ass, making him gasp around Ava's cock. The pain was intense, but the drugs made every sensation more intense, turning pain into pleasure. He could feel her thickness stretching him, filling him up. His own cock throbbed with need, begging for release.

Ava pulled out of his mouth, panting slightly. "Look at you," she said, her eyes glinting with satisfaction. "You're loving this, aren't you?"

David couldn't lie, even if he wanted to. His body was on fire, and the thought of these three beautiful creatures using him in such a degrading way was making him harder than he'd ever been before. He nodded, his eyes pleading for more.

The girls took this as an invitation to up the ante. They pulled out a variety of sex toys, each one more terrifying than the last. Ava produced a strap-on with a cock that was even larger than hers, smearing it with lubricant before sliding it into his mouth. "Practice makes perfect," she said, her voice filled with amusement.

Lyssara continued to fuck him, her pace increasing until he was sure he'd pass out from the sheer pleasure of it all. Alexandria took the strap-on from Ava and began to tease his ass with it, the coldness of the material a stark contrast to the heat of their bodies.

"Ready?" she asked, her voice a seductive purr.

Lyssara pulled out, and before he could even answer, Alexandria slammed the strap-on into him, making him cry out around the thick cock in his mouth. The combination of pain and pleasure was overwhelming, and he could feel his mind begin to crack under their relentless assault.

They fucked him mercilessly, switching positions and toys, pushing his body to its limits. They used his cock to pleasure themselves, taking turns riding him until they were screaming with orgasm. His own climax was denied, the drugs keeping him on the edge without release.

The room spun as they continued, his mind swimming in a sea of pleasure and pain. They whispered sweet, dirty nothings in his ear, telling him how much they owned him, how much they loved watching him squirm and beg.

Hours passed, or maybe it was days. Time lost all meaning as he became their plaything, their living sex doll to be used and discarded. They broke him down until he was nothing more than an object for their amusement.

But even as he lay there, bound and broken, he couldn't help but crave more. The thought of them using him, filling him, owning him, was all he could think about. He was theirs, completely and utterly, and he never wanted it to end.

The three futanari goddesses looked down at him, their bodies slick with sweat and cum. "Good boy," Ava murmured, stroking his cheek. "You're learning so quickly."

Lyssara leaned in for a kiss, her tongue tasting of his own cum. "We're going to have so much fun with you."

And with that, the room went dark as they continued to claim him, their bodies moving in a symphony of lust and dominance. David could only lay there and take it, his mind shattered into a million pieces of pure, unadulterated desire. He was theirs, and he knew he would never be the same again.
